Hey everyone, how is it going ? 
This is Amir from Bek Brace, hope you're doing well today.
And Today, we're diving into something practical and useful: 

Building a tax calculator application in C. 
Now, you might be wondering, why a tax calculator? 
Well, besides being a real-world application that many people can benefit from, it's also a 
fantastic way to learn and practice some essential concepts in C programming.

So, what can you expect to learn from this tutorial? 
Well, we'll start by understanding how to handle files in C. 
We'll see how to save and retrieve data, which will be crucial for storing our tax calculation results and ensuring that user data is persistent across sessions.

Next up, we'll dive into calculations. 
We'll be crunching numbers to calculate things like ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) 
contributions and income tax based on the user's input. 
And don't worry if math isn't your strongest suit â€“ we'll break it down step by step.

Of course, we'll also learn about user interaction. 
We'll be prompting the user to enter their gross salary and then displaying the calculated results in a way that's easy to understand and navigate. It's all about making our application user-friendly and intuitive.

Now, we can't talk about taxes without touching on conditional statements. 
We'll use these to determine tax rates based on predefined thresholds, ensuring that our application can handle different income levels accurately.

And finally, we'll see the power of functions in C. We'll modularize our code, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This not only makes our code cleaner and easier to read but also sets us up for easier maintenance and scalability in the future.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional tax calculator application written in C. 
Before we get started, let me show you the application on hand, the rates are valid and predefined in Poland, as you might have guessed, but you can modify the rates according to your country, of course.

So, without further ado, let's jump right in and get started on our C tax calculator project!
Let me open my Ubuntu machine, to install the GNU compiler and for general setup to code in C, please refer to my first lesson in C, I have explained how to do it in details.
